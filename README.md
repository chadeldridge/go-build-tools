# go-build-tools
A collection of tools used to build, package, and release go applications.

I like the idea behind goreleaser but had problems with it and wanted something more modular and using multiple unix style tools which can be used throughout the development process and not just for release. After writing my own bash scripts I decided to pivot to creating full tools written in Go.
